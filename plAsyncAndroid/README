This project contains the Android client libraries and Test App for plAsync.  The project is built
using Android Studio and Gradle against Android 4.2.  The project has the following modules.

ContentProviderContract - An Android library that provides constants for the plAsync Content
                          Provider.  This library is used by the DataManager and the SDK

DataManager - An Android application that contains a Content Provider implementation for accessing
              locally stored plAsync Configuration that is applicable across multiple apps,
              i.e. plAsync user name and id.

SDK - An Android library that interacts with the server to provide plAsync functionality to
      Android apps.

TestApp - An android application that can exercise all of the plAsync functionality including
          adding friends, sending game invites, and updating game state.

google-play-services_lib - The Google Play Services library, used for Google Cloud Messaging, which
                           must be included as a module in the project so that some of the resources
                           get merged in correctly with the application.
